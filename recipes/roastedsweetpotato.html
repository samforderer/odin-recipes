    <p>Sweet potatoes are roasted to perfection with chunky onion wedges and garlic, then finished with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar for a naturally sweet holiday side dish. My Granny made this for Easter dinner. We were all sitting at the table commenting on how delicious it was and asked for the recipe.</p>
